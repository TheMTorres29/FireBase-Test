        <h3>10/24</h3>
        <p>Learning firebase right now</p>
        <br><hr><br>

        <h3>11/16</h3>
        <p>Added a login the other day. Now imma fix this app up a lil :)</p>
        <br><hr><br>

        <h3>11/17</h3>
        <p>Im starting this portion at 11:22 after work. Lets see how far i progress</p>
        <br><hr><br>

        <h3>11/18</h3>
        <p>I added an icon for the tab. Put spaceman higher up and on this page as well.
        I also moved the pokemon from the carousel more to the left near the big pokeball.
        I began learning about firestore. I made some stuff in the db. We'll see what else
        I can do with it soon :^)</p>
        <br><hr><br>

        <h3>11/20</h3>
        <p>Added transition effects to the pokemon in the carousel. Looks kinda neat. Also
        people can sign up now :0 Thats crazy. The logged in people dont get any benefit
        lol But there will be features soon. At least people can sign up and see they are
        logged in. AND the pokemon look cool hangin n danglin there. Might do something with
        that</p>
        <br><hr><br>

        <p>I am going to watch an hour long videon on YouTube about Cloud FireStore. Let's get this project DONE!
        I could've finished way earlier but I told myself I was "busy" with other classes and work...which is kinda
        true BUT i couldve made time lol Anyways. Hopefully I get this done right now :)</p>

        <h3>12/7 Cloud FireStore UPDATE</h3>
        <p>I did the minimum lol Nah, I set up the firestore and I can now have people post "reviews" of games.
        It's supposed to be pokemon games only but I will work on that in the future during break. I really do
        want to make this a real working app for my resume. I have a lot of ideas but no time right now to
        implement them. BUT I WILL ;0</p>
